**Task**: Compare scenarios from different countries' COVID-19 Response to emphasize the problem of relying on a single metric such as accuracy for prediction.

**Problem Setting**: At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital authorities had to make a call about who to admit and who to send home given the limited available resources. Our problem is to have a classifier that suggests whether a patient should be immediately admitted to the hospital or sent home.

**The Data**: The data consists of the following predictors:
- Age
- Sex
- Cough
- Fever
- Chills
- Sore Throat
- Headache
- Fatigue

The outcome is a classification prediction to indicate the urgency of admission.
- **Positive**: Indicates that a patient that was admitted within 1 day from the onset of symptoms.
- **Negative**: Indicates everyone else.
